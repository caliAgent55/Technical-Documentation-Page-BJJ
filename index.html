       <p><code>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)</code> Is a self-defense martial art and combat sport based on grappling, ground fighting and submission holds, It focuses on the skill of taking an opponent to the ground, controlling one's opponent, gaining a dominant position and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks or chokeholds (Newaza).</p>

       <p><code>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</code> was first developed and modified in the 1920s by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr, George and Hélio Gracie after Carlos Gracie was taught traditional Kodokan Judo by a travelling Japanese judoka (Mitsuyo Maeda) in 1917, later going on to develop their own self-defense system named Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.</p>

       <p><code>BJJ</code> eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices and adaptation of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and Judo with governing bodies such as the IBJJF working worldwide, becoming an essential martial art for MMA.</p>

       <p><code>BJJ </code>revolves around the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat them. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling and in self-defence situations.[7] Sparring, commonly referred to as "rolling" within the BJJ community, and live drilling plays a major role in training and the practitioner's development. BJJ is considered a martial art, a sport, a method of promoting physical fitness and building character, and a way of life.</p>

      <header>History</header>
            <p><strong>Name: "Jiu-Jitsu"</strong> derives from an older romanization of its original spelling in the West (is still in common use); the modern Hepburn romanization of<strong> 柔術 </strong>is<code> "jūjutsu"</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>Origins:</strong>
Geo Omori opened the first Jiu-Jitsu/Judo school in Brazil in 1925. He taught a number of individuals, including Luiz França. Later, Mitsuyo Maeda one of five Kodokan's top groundwork experts (newaza) trained by judo's founder Kano Jigoro was sent overseas to demonstrate and spread his art to the world. He left Japan in 1904 and visited a number of countries giving "jiu-do" demonstrations and accepting challenges from wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters, and various other martial artists, and arrived in Brazil on 14 November 1914.Maeda had trained first in sumo as a teenager, and after the interest generated by stories about the success of Kodokan judo at competitions with other jujutsu schools of the time, he became a student of Kano.</p>

     <p><strong>Gracie & Maeda:</strong>
Gastão Gracie was a business partner of the American Circus in Belém. In 1916, Italian Argentine circus Queirolo Brothers staged shows there and presented Maeda. In 1917 Carlos Gracie (eldest son of Gastão Gracie) watched a ‘Kano Jiu-Jitsu’ demonstration by Maeda at the Da Paz Theatre and decided he wanted to learn. Maeda accepted Carlos as a student and Carlos was taught for a few years (believed 5–6 years), eventually passing his knowledge on to his brothers. Gracie's account of the events is that his younger sibling Hélio Gracie gradually developed Gracie jiu-jitsu as a softer, pragmatic adaptation that focused more on the ground fighting and leverage aspect of Judo (newaza) rather than the throws, as he was unable to perform many Judo throws (due to his size) that require direct opposition to an opponent's strength.</p>

<p>Although the Gracie family is typically recognized as the main family to first promote <code>Brazilian jiu-jitsu </code>as it is known today, there was also another prominent lineage derived from Maeda via another Brazilian disciple, Luiz França. This lineage had been represented particularly by Oswaldo Fadda. Fadda and his students were famous for the influential use of footlocks, and the lineage still survives through Fadda's links in teams such as Nova União and Grappling Fight Team (GF Team).</p>

<p>When Maeda left Japan, judo was still often referred to as "Kano jiu-jitsu",or, even more generically, simply as jiu-jitsu. Higashi, the co-author of Kano Jiu-Jitsu wrote in the foreword:</p>

<i>Some confusion has arisen over the employment of the term 'jiudo'. To make the matter clear I will state that jiudo is the term selected by Professor Kano as describing his system more accurately than jiu-jitsu does. Professor Kano is one of the leading educators of Japan, and it is natural that he should cast about for the technical word that would most accurately describe his system. But the Japanese people generally still cling to the more popular nomenclature and call it jiu-jitsu.</i>

<p>Outside Japan, however, this distinction was noted even less. Thus, when Maeda and Satake arrived in Brazil in 1914, every newspaper announced their art as being "jiu-jitsu", despite both men being Kodokan judoka.</p>

<p>It was not until 1925 that the Japanese government itself officially mandated that the correct name for the martial art taught in the Japanese public schools should be "judo" rather than "jujutsu". In Brazil, the art is still called "jiu-jitsu". When the Gracies went to the United States and spread jiu-jitsu, they used the terms <code>"Gracie jiu-jitsu" </code>and non-Gracies using the term <code>”Brazilian jiu-jitsu” </code>to differentiate from the already present styles using similar-sounding names. In a 1994 interview with Yoshinori Nishi, Hélio Gracie said that he didn't even know the word of Judo itself until the sport came in the 1950s to Brazil, because he heard that Mitsuyo Maeda called his style "jiu-jitsu".</p>

<p>The art is sometimes referred to as Gracie jiu-jitsu (GJJ), a name trademarked by Rorion Gracie, but after a legal dispute with his cousin Carley Gracie, his trademark to the name was voided. Other members of the Gracie family often call their style by personalized names, such as Ceaser Gracie Jiu-Jitsu or Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and similarly, the Machado family call their style Machado Jiu-Jitsu (MJJ). While each style and its instructors have their own unique aspects, they are all basic variations of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. There are currently four major BJJ branches in Brazil: Gracie Humaita, Gracie Barra, Carlson Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and Alliance Jiu Jitsu. Each branch traces its roots back to Mitsuyo Maeda via Donato Pires Dos Reis, and then through the Gracie family or Oswaldo Fadda.</p>

<p>Brazilian jiu-jitsu has vast similarities to the original Kodokan judo, widely practised before Judo became part of the Olympics, and still practised in a lesser extent, as well as some similarity to earlier ryu (schools) Ju-Jitsu.</p>

      <p><strong>Divergence from Kodokan rules:</strong>
Certain changes were made to the rules of sport judo after judo was introduced to Brazil. Some of these rule changes sought to enhance it as a spectator sport, and others aimed to improve safety. Several of these rule changes de-emphasized the groundwork aspects of judo, and others have reduced the range of joint locks application. Brazilian jiu-jitsu did not follow these changes to judo rules, and this divergence gave BJJ a distinct identity as a grappling art, although it's still recognizably related to judo. Other factors that have contributed towards the stylistic divergence of BJJ from the sport judo include the Gracies' contribution to the art, including the emphasis on full-contact fighting.</p>

<p>BJJ permits the same techniques that judo allows when taking combat to the ground. These include judo's scoring throws as well as judo's non-scoring techniques that it refers to as "skillful takedowns" (such as the flying armbar). BJJ also allows any and all takedowns used in wrestling, sambo, or any other grappling arts, including direct attempts to take down by touching the legs. Spinal locks and cervical locks are not allowed in gi jiu-jitsu, amateur MMA, multiple forms of no-gi jiu-jitsu, Judo, and other martial arts, due to potential to cause serious bodily injury.</p>

<p>BJJ also differs from judo in that it also allows a competitor to drag opponents to the ground. Although early Kodokan judo rules were initially similar to BJJ's, in recent years, it has become increasingly restrictive in comparison. BJJ has also become more "sports-oriented" in recent years, prohibiting techniques such as slams.</p>

      <p>Clothing can be broken down into Gi and No-gi.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner's uniform (commonly referred to using the Japanese terms gi or kimono) is similar to a judogi, but often made of lighter material with tighter cuffs on the pants and jacket. This allows the practitioner to benefit from a closer fit, providing less material for an opponent to manipulate, although there is a significant overlap in the standards that allows for a carefully selected gi to be legal for competition in both styles. Traditionally, to be promoted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the wearing of the Jiu-Jitsu gi while training is a requirement.</p>

      <p>Clothing for gi training is what would be considered traditional and consists of the following items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gi top or Jacket</li>
        <li>Gi bottoms or Pants</li>
        <li>Colored Belt(depending on level of skill)</li>
      </ul>
        <h5>No-Gi</h5>

        </figure> 
      <p>Recently with the growing popularity of "no-gi" Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the practice of giving out belts to no gi practitioners (e.g., Rolles Gracie awarding Rashad Evans a black belt) has become more common. Attire is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Top(some kind of shirt)</li>
        <li>Bottoms(some kind of shorts or pants)</li>
      </ul>
        <p>There are certain differences between "[Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi|gi]" jiu-jitsu and "no-gi" jiu-jitsu. In "[Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi|gi]" jiu-jitsu, one can grip an opponent's uniform, using it to submit or advance position. There are a number of submissions that are specific to the gi, such as the "Loop choke", "Collar choke", and others. "No-gi" jiu-jitsu does not allow uniform grips.</p>

      <p><strong>Ground Fighting </strong> BJJ is mainly differentiated from other martial arts by its greater emphasis on ground fighting. Commonly, striking-based martial arts place little to no emphasis on groundwork. BJJ also places little emphasis on standing techniques, such as striking and throws, although it employs some basic takedowns, such as single and double leg takedowns, and some BJJ clubs and practitioners cross train with wrestling, judo, and sambo. </p>
      <p><strong>Side Control </strong> In side control, the practitioner pins his opponent to the ground from the side of their torso. The top grappler lies across the opponent with weight applied to the opponent's chest. The opponent may be further controlled by pressure on either side of the shoulders and hips from the practitioner's elbows, shoulders, and knees. A wide variety of submissions can be initiated from side control. It is also referred to as the side mount. Additionally, the typical side mount increases opportunity for the top grappler to advance to other dominant positions. This position is often used in MMA as it allows the top fighter to strike whilst overcoming their opponents defence. There are many variants of the side control position, including kesa gatame, standard side control, reverse side control, and other positions.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Knee on Belly </strong> The knee on belly position is a modified side pin that is distinctly separated from the side control position. The knee on belly position is characterized primarily by the control of the opponent with one leg out for base and balance and the other leg positioned across the opponent's torso pinning them to the ground. This form of pin is a mobile pin rather than a static pin and is considered a more dominant position in many grappling formats. The knee on belly position is worth additional points because it provides a greater striking platform than traditional side control and is closer to achieving the more ideal mounted position.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Full Mount </strong> In the mount (or full mount) position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent's front torso or chest, controlling the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form of this position, the practitioner works his knees into the opponent's armpits to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter submission attempts. Full Mount can be used to apply a variety of submissions including armlocks or chokes.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Back Mount</strong> When taking the back mount position (often known in Brazilian jiu-jitsu as the back grab or attacking the back), the practitioner attaches to the back of the opponent by wrapping his legs around and hooking the opponent's thighs with their heel,[49] or locking in a body triangle by crossing one shin across the waist like a belt then placing the back of the opposing knee over the instep as if finishing a triangle choke. Simultaneously, the upper body is controlled by wrapping the arms around the chest or neck of the opponent. This position is often used to apply chokeholds, as well as arm bars and triangles, and neutralizes an opponent's potential size or strength advantage.</p>
      
      <p><strong>North/South </strong> The North South position occurs when a practitioner is lying on their back on the ground and their opponent is lying on top, with the head over the chest area and controlling the bottom practitioner's arms. As with most top controlling positions in BJJ, the top practitioner applies pressure by bringing their hips downwards towards the ground, generating what is referred to as dead weight. There are several submissions and transitions that are possible from the North South position, most commonly the North South choke, North South kimura, and others.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Guard(s) </strong> When in the "Guard" position, the practitioner is on their back controlling an opponent with his legs. The bottom practitioner pushes and pulls with the legs or feet to unbalance and limit the movements of his opponent. This position allows practitioners a wide variety of counter-attacks from the bottom position, including submissions and sweeps.</p>

<h5>The three most common types of guards include:<strong> the Closed Guard, Half Guard, and Open Guard.</strong></h5>

<p>In closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the opponent's hips, with ankles closed together to control their opponent. The closed guard can be an effective position. This guard allows many setups for submissions such as jointlocks and chokes, as well as sweeps. In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull their opponent.</p>

<p>There are many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning including the Butterfly Guard, De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, Rubber guard, Spider Guard, Octopus Guard, Lapel Guard, Worm Guard (made popular by Keenan Cornelius) and others. Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name is derived from the resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to manoeuvre and the ability counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the feet against the competitor's inner thighs.</p>

<p>In the half guard, one of the top grappler's legs is controlled by the bottom grappler's legs, preventing the top opponent from passing side control or full mount positions. There is also a variant of half guard called "50/50 guard", which consist of each opponent usually in sitting positions with one of their legs hooking the same leg of their opponent in a mirrored fashion. This position is called 50/50 because neither opponent has a distinct advantage, where both sides have the same possibilities of sweeps and attacks.</p>

<p>Another variation of the half guard position is the "deep half guard", which involves the bottom grappler positioning themselves underneath their opponent, grabbing the top grappler's thigh. This gives the individual on the bottom the opportunity to sweep their opponent, and end up on a more dominant, top position. This position was popularized by American BJJ Black Belt, Jeff Glover.</p>

       </figure>
           
            <p>The Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system awards a practitioner different coloured belts to signify increasing levels of technical knowledge and practical skill. While the system's structure shares its origins with the judo ranking system and the origins of all coloured belts, it now contains many of its own unique aspects and themes. Some of these differences are relatively minor, such as the division between youth and adult belts and the stripe/degree system. Others are quite distinct and have become synonymous with the art, such as a marked informality in promotional criteria, including as a focus on a competitive demonstration of skill, and a conservative approach to promotion in general.</p>
       <p>Traditionally, the concept of competitive skill demonstration as a quickened and earned route of promotion holds true. Some schools have placed a green belt for adults between the white and blue belt ranks due to the long periods between advancement. In addition, the use of a grey belt has been instituted for many children's programs to signal progress between the white and yellow belt rankings.</p>
       <p>Unlike in some martial arts such as taekwondo and karate, a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu commonly takes more than several years to earn, and the rank is generally considered expert level. The amount of time it takes to achieve the rank of black belt varies between the practitioner. Some notable individuals who had previous backgrounds in other martial arts have been promoted directly to black belt rank without going through any intermediate rank, though this has fallen out of favour in recent times. Others have achieved the rank in relatively short time frames. Outside of exceptions such as these, the average time frame is around 10 years with a consistent training schedule. However, Ryron Gracie (grandson/grandnephew of founders Hélio and Carlos Gracie) has stated that the average of 10–12 years is longer than necessary, suggesting that the ego of the practitioner often hinders progress, and advancement to black belt should take 7 years.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="health_considerations">
       <header>Health Considerations</header>
              
        <p><strong>Safety </strong> Brazilian jiu-jitsu is one of the safest full contact martial arts for practitioners. Its injury rate is around 9.2-38.6 per 1000 athlete exposures. This is lower than in mixed martial arts (236-286 per 1000), boxing (210-420 per 1000), judo (25.3-130.6) and taekwondo (20.5-139.5). It is similar to wrestling, which also uses grappling instead of striking. The few injuries that may be incurred in Brazilian jiu-jitsu usually affect the joints and rarely the head. The most common injuries Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners suffer from are ACL tears in the knees, rotator cuff tears in the shoulders and spinal disc herniations, most commonly in the neck region. Many are repairable via surgery that require an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training. Also many athletes suffer from minor injuries, such as elbow and wrist tendonitis, due to overtraining and the grappling nature of the martial art, which can be strenuous and taxing for the joints and the tendons.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Skin Health </strong> Besides the normal strains and pulls associated with most martial arts, Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners (along with Wrestlers, Judoka, and other grapplers ) are exposed to regular skin abrasions and potential unsanitary mat conditions. They are thus at higher risk for developing skin disease. Several commonly contracted skin diseases include ringworm, impetigo, herpes gladiatorum, and staph infection. Proper hygiene practices, including regular cleaning of classroom mats, showering immediately after class with soap, disinfecting and covering any open wounds, thorough cleaning of any gi/rashguard/headgear used before the next class, not sharing used towels/uniforms, and using a barrier cream greatly reduces the chance of contracting a disease.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cauliflower Ear </strong> Due to the use of the head to maintain position and attack in jiu-jitsu, the ears can easily be damaged and begin to swell. Without immediate medical treatment, the cartilage in a swollen ear will separate from the perichondrium that supplies its nutrients and will become permanently swollen/deformed (cauliflower ear). Wrestling headgear is sometimes used for the prevention of this condition. Treatment includes draining the hematoma or surgery.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Performance-Enhancing Drugs </strong> The practice of taking performance-enhancing drugs, including anabolic steroids, is believed to be relatively commonplace among competitors in jiu-jitsu tournaments and has sparked letters and public statements by some of jiu-jitsu's top competitors, including Comprido and Caio Terra. In response, the IBJJF began testing for performance-enhancing drugs at IBJJF sponsored events, starting with the 2013 Pan American Championship. However, most other tournaments tend to lack PED testing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cervical and Spinal Locks "Neck Cranks" </strong> A spinal lock is a multiple joint lock applied to the spinal column, which is performed by forcing the spine beyond its normal ranges of motion. This is typically done by bending or twisting the head or upper body into abnormal positions. Commonly, spinal locks might strain the spinal musculature or result in a mild spinal sprain, while a forcefully and/or suddenly applied spinal lock may cause severe ligament damage or damage to the vertebrae, and possibly result in serious spinal cord injury, strokes, or death. Spinal locks and cervical locks are completely forbidden from gi jiu-jitsu, amateur MMA, multiple forms of no-gi jiu-jitsu, Judo, and other martial arts. Due to its illegal nature and express purpose to cause serious, irrevocable bodily injury, paralysis, and death, its use both inside and outside of the gym can constitute aggravated assault. The forceful application of chokes such as the Rear Naked Choke and subsequent cranking of the neck whilst being choked can potentially lead to arterial dissection, which could lead to stroke. Due care should be exercised when applying these chokes in sparring situations.</p>
